# This is the jenkins build script for building/testing the gulinalg
# module.
#
# In order to work, Jenkins should be configured such as:
#  - Anaconda is installed in ~/anaconda
#  - Jenkins build matrix is used for multiple platforms/python
#    versions
#  - Use XShell plugin to launch this script (on Windows, the
#    .bat version will be executed instead)
#  - Call the script from the root workspace directory as
#    buildscripts/jenkins-build
