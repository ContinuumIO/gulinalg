    Compute the determinant of arrays, with broadcasting.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : (NDIMS, M, M) array
        Input array. Its inner dimensions must be those of a square 2-D array.

    Returns
    -------
    det : (NDIMS) array
        Determinants of `a`

    The determinants are computed via LU factorization using the LAPACK

    Examples
    --------
    The determinant of a 2-D array [[a, b], [c, d]] is ad - bc:

    Compute the sign and (natural) logarithm of the determinant of an array,

    If an array has a very small or very large determinant, then a call to
    `det` may overflow or underflow. This routine is more robust against such
    issues, because it computes the logarithm of the determinant rather than
    the determinant itself

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : (..., M, M) array
        Input array. Its inner dimensions must be those of a square 2-D array.

    Returns
    -------
    sign : (...) array
        An array of numbers representing the sign of the determinants. For real
        matrices, this is 1, 0, or -1. For complex matrices, this is a complex
        number with absolute value 1 (i.e., it is on the unit circle), or else
        0.
    logdet : (...) array
        The natural log of the absolute value of the determinant. This is always
        a real type.

    If the determinant is zero, then `sign` will be 0 and `logdet` will be -Inf.
    In all cases, the determinant is equal to ``sign * np.exp(logdet)``.

    Compute the (multiplicative) inverse of symmetric/hermitian positive
    definite matrices, with broadcasting.

    Given a square symmetic/hermitian positive-definite matrix `a`, return
    the matrix `ainv` satisfying ``matrix_multiply(a, ainv) =
    matrix_multiply(ainv, a) = Identity matrix``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : (..., M, M) array
        Symmetric/hermitian postive definite matrices to be inverted.

    Returns
    -------
    ainv : (..., M, M) array
        (Multiplicative) inverse of the `a` matrices.

    Notes
    -----
    Numpy broadcasting rules apply.

    The inverse is computed using LAPACK routines _potrf, _potri

    For elements where the LAPACK routine fails, the result will be set
    to NaNs.

    Implemented for types single, double, csingle and cdouble. Numpy conversion
    rules apply.

    inv : compute the multiplicative inverse of general matrices.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[5, 3], [3, 5]])
    >>> ainv = poinv(a)
    >>> np.allclose(matrix_multiply(a, ainv), np.eye(2))
    True
    >>> np.allclose(matrix_multiply(ainv, a), np.eye(2))
