gulinalg
========

Linear algebra functions as Generalized Ufuncs.


Notes about building
====================

This module is built using NumPy's configuration for LAPACK. This means that
you need a setup similar to the one used to build the NumPy you are using. If
you are building your own version of NumPy that should be the case.
